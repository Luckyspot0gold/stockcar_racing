# BTC: Momentum drives speed
speed = base_speed + (5min_momentum * 2)

# SOL: Volatility with jitter effects
speed = base_speed + (volatility * 1.5)
jitter_intensity = volatility * 2  # Visual shake effect

# AVAX: Volume delta impact
speed = base_speed + (volume_delta * 1.2)

# DOGE: Social sentiment simulation
speed = base_speed + (sentiment * 3)
